# deno-react

deno-react is a *very* minimalist react boilerplate.

### Example
View the example at [deno-react.deno.dev](https://deno-react.deno.dev).

### Getting Started

All you have to do is add your pages in the `/pages` folder and run `deno task start`! Make sure not to remove `/pages/_404.tsx`, otherwise you'll start returning `Internal Server Error` - you can style it however you'd like though!
